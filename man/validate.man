.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I INDEX\-FILE
Path to a index file;
.TP
.I INDEX\-LOG
Path to a log file created during \fIINDEX\-FILE\fR construction;
.TP
.I RESIDUES\-FEATURE
Path to a feature file with residue type three-letters codes;
.TP

Path to a feature file with measured composition of residues;
.TP
.I COMPOSITIONS\-VALID
Path to a file saying what are valid compositions of residue types;

.TP
.BR -h ", " --help
Show informations about the program.
.SS Validators:
What should be checked and what thresholds should be used.
Not all of the previously mentioned files are mandatory for all validations, if a file is not used in any test,
a dummy value can be used for the corresponding argument (but the argument cannot be leaved out to have input less prone to errors).
.TP
.BI \-a INCOMPLETE\-ABS
There can be at most \fIINCOMPLETE\-ABS\fR incomplete (or missing) residues within the whole protein.
The default value of \fIINCOMPLETE\-ABS\fR (if missing or empty) is 50.
Mandatory are \fIINDEX\-FILE\fR, \fIINDEX\-LOG\fR, \fIRESIDUES\-FEATURE\fR, \fICOMPOSITIONS\-FEATURE\fR, \fICOMPOSITIONS\-VALID\fR and an used iterator.
.TP
.B \-b
Filter out proteins without Remark 350 in PDB file (or equivalent in PDBML/PDBc file).
Mandatory is \fIINDEX\-LOG\fR.
.TP
.BI \-c MIN\-CHAINS
There must be at least \fIMIN\-CHAINS\fR chains within all biomolecules.
The default value of \fIMIN\-CHAINS\fR (if missing or empty) is 2.
Mandatory is \fIINDEX\-FILE\fR.
.TP
.B \-d
All biomolecules must have the same number of chains.
Mandatory is \fIINDEX\-FILE\fR.
.TP
.BI \-l MIN\-LENGTH
Each chain must have at least \fIMIN\-LENGTH\fR residues.
The default value of \fIMIN\-LENGTH\fR(if missing or empty) is 20.
Mandatory are \fIINDEX\-FILE\fR, \fIINDEX\-LOG\fR and an used iterator.
.TP
.B \-n
There cannot be any HETATM record.
Mandatory are \fIPROTEINS\-PATH\fRs.
.TP
.BI \-r INCOMPLETE\-REL
There can be at most 100*\fIINCOMPLETE\-REL\fR % of residues incomplete (or missing) within each chain.
The default value of \fIINCOMPLETE\-REL\fR (if missing or empty) is 0.05.
Mandatory are \fIINDEX\-FILE\fR, \fIINDEX\-LOG\fR, \fIRESIDUES\-FEATURE\fR, \fICOMPOSITIONS\-FEATURE\fR, \fICOMPOSITIONS\-VALID\fR and an used iterator.
.TP
.B \-u
There cannot be any unknown residue.
Mandatory are \fIINDEX\-FILE\fR, \fIRESIDUES\-FEATURE\fR and \fIRESIDUES\-VALID\fR.
.SS Iterators:
What iterator was used to construction of the index file (if no iterator is specified, only the first biomolecule from the first model with the first crystallographic transformation were used):
.TP
.B \-ib
All biomolecules and models, but only the first crystallographic transformation were used;
.TP
.B \-ic
All crystallographic transformations, but only the first biomolecule and model were used;
.TP
.B \-ibc
All biomolecules, models and crystallographic transformations were used;
.TP
.B \-iw
Both biomolecules and crystallographic transformation were ignored, all chains were used as they were;
