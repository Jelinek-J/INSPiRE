.SH DESCRIPTION
Extracts required features from proteins indexed in a given index file.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I INDEX\-FILE
Path to a index file
.TP
\fB\-s\fR
Save each feature in a separate file (otherwise all features are stored together in one file)
.TP
\fIOUTPUT\-PATH\fR
Where to store output file.

If '\fB\-s\fR' is typed, \fIOUTPUT\-PATH\fR must be a directory; and
each feature is stored in a separated file named according to the corresponding feature with '.tur' as an extension.

Otherwise (if '\fB\-s\fR' is not typed), all features are stored in the same file.
If \fIOUTPUT\-PATH\fR is a directory or ends with a directory separator, 'features.tur' is used as the file name.
If \fIOUTPUT\-PATH\fR does not end with '.tur' extension, the extension is appended.
.TP
.I PROTEINS\-PATH
Path to a protein or a directory with proteins
.TP
.BR -h ", " --help
Show informations about the program
.SS Iterators:
.TP
.B \-b
All biomolecules and models, but only the first crystallographic transformation are used
.TP
.B \-c
All crystallographic transformations, but only the first biomolecule and model are used
.TP
.B \-bc
All biomolecules, models and crystallographic transformations are used
.TP
.B \-w
Ignore both biomolecules and crystallographic transformation, use all chains as they are
.TP
If no iterator is specified, only the first biomolecule from the first model with the first crystallographic transformation is used
.SS Features:
.TP
\fB\-a\fR\fITRANSFORMATION\-FILE\fR
Aminoacid type three-letter code is transformed with transformation defined in \fITRANSFORMATION\-FILE\fR, that should be in format 'key<TAB>value'
.TP
.B \-c
Coordinates of carbon_alpha of an aminoacid
.TP
.B \-e
Atomic composition of a residue (helium and deuterium are skipped)
.TP
\fB\-i\fR\fIRADII\-FILE\fR[\fIDISTANCE\fR]
Whether a residue is an interfacial residue with \fR\fIRADII\-FILE\fR defining radiuses of chemical elements and
\fIDISTANCE\fR sets the maximal allowed distance of two van der Waals radiuses (0.5A is a default value).
\fIDISTANCE\fR must be separated by a space from \fIRADII\-FILE\fR
.TP
\fB\-r\fR\fIRADII\-FILE\fR;\fICOMPOSITION\-FILE\fR;\fIMAX\-SASA\-FILE
Relative solvent accessible surface area with residues' composition defined in \fICOMPOSITION\-FILE\fR, 
atomic radiuses defined in \fIRADII\-FILE\fR and reference solvent accessible surface areas defined in \fIMAX\-SASA\-FILE\fR.
.TP
.B \-t
Temperature factor of an aminoacid
.SH FORMAT OF FEATURE FILES
.SS Header line
The first line of each feature file;
names of columns (features) are separated by a tabulator.
.SS Data line
Each feature is separated by a tabulator, if it is not possible to extract an feature, the corresponding cell is empty.
Defaultly, index of each line is an index of the previous line plus one (the first line has index '1').
If a line has not consecutive index, the index is specified in an extra (last) column.
.SH NOTE
RASA feature may not be available if it is not specified during compilation as it requires an external library.
.SH TO DO
Actually, the specification of iterator is redundant and should be specified in the index file.
