.SH DESCRIPTION
Randomly selects 100 protein chains (at most one chain from each protein) with mutual similarity less than a given threshold.

Selected chains will be printed in format \fIPROTEIN-ID\fB.\fICHAIN-ID\fR.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I OUTPUT\-FILE
Where to store identifiers of selected chains.
.TP
\fB\-c\fICOUNT
How many of dissimilar chains should be selected. The default count is 100.
.TP
\fB\-s\fISEED
Seed to initialize a random generator. The default seed is 1.
.TP
\fB\-t\fITHRESHOLD
Limit to consider chains as similar. The default threshold is 0.1.
.TP
\fB\-\fR \fIHEADER
Header to use in the output file for a following pair of input files.

The hyphen/minus sign is mandatory only if \fIHEADER\fR starts with a hyphen/minus sign.
.TP
.I INDEX\-FILE
Path to a index file containing chains that can be selected
.TP
.I SIMILARITY\-FILE
Path to a similarity file defining similarity of chains
.TP

.SS Iterators:
What iterator was used to construction of the index file:
.TP
.B \-b
All biomolecules and models, but only the first crystallographic transformation were used;
.TP
.B \-c
All crystallographic transformations, but only the first biomolecule and model were used;
.TP
.B \-bc
All biomolecules, models and crystallographic transformations were used;
.TP
.B \-f
Only the first biomolecule from the first model with the first crystallographic transformation were used (this is the default option);
.TP
.B \-w
Both biomolecules and crystallographic transformation were ignored, all chains were used as they were;
